First, run the PythonAppliction1.py in COLAB for diseased and non-diseased classification from the "Code and Results for Image Classification" directory. It will give you diseased and non-diseased predicting classes.
Then, execute the SegmentationAndAnnotation.ipynb file from the "Code and Results for Image Segmentation and Classification" directory. This will detect the cancer's location in breast tissue. 
Before this, you have to annotate the images using some tool to use a new dataset of images.
